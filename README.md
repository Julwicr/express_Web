First website started after le Wagon bootcamp. </br>
https://www.julienrolland.net/

<h2>Config.</h2>
- Express js
- Sass

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>I started to create this website to practice javascript and creating a portfolio at the same time. </br> I am using express instead of rails to keep the framework as simple as possible for now. The front end has be done only with vanilla javascript so far. </br> The site is still in progress and will have many changes as I learn new skills. </p>
